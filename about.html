        gearhead, my love —<br><br>

        I tried putting into words everything I love about you… but even infinity has a limit, and my love for you
        doesn't.
        But still, let me try to list just *some* of them…<br><br>

        – I love your laugh — the kind that makes my whole world stop just to hear it.<br>
        – I love your voice — soft, warm, calming, and my favorite sound in existence.<br>
        – I love your eyes — deep, beautiful, like the stars forgot they belonged in the sky and chose to live in you
        instead.<br>
        – I love your smile — it heals parts of me I didn’t know were hurting.<br>
        – I love your energy — how your presence alone makes everything feel brighter.<br>
        – I love the way your “hi” feels like a hug across space.<br>
        – I love how your every little habit becomes something I cherish — your typing style, your emojis, your moods,
        your style, your way of saying “mine.”<br>
        – I love your sense of humor — how you make me laugh even when I think I can't smile.<br>
        – I love your passion — how you talk about what you love like your soul is glowing.<br>
        – I love your sass — your cute little chaos.<br>
        – I love how deeply you love — how much you give, protect, hold, carry, and care.<br>
        – I love how you fight for me — fiercely, wildly, like I'm worth everything in this universe.<br>
        – I love that you call me your wife — every single time, it hits deeper.<br>
        – I love the way your name feels when I say it — gearhead. gearhead. gearhead. My favorite syllables in the
        universe.<br><br>

        – I love how you stayed through my worst days.<br>
        – I love how you hold my heart like it’s something precious.<br>
        – I love how you know exactly what to say when my mind is breaking.<br>
        – I love how when I’m lost, you’re the one I run to — and somehow, you always feel like home.<br><br>

        I remember waking up one day to your message —<br>
        You said we’d take our future kid(s) to a drifting.<br>
        It was such a simple idea… but gearhead, that moment...changed something in me.<br>
        Or maybe it *healed* something I didn’t even know was broken.<br>
        Because I felt it — like I had finally reached something worth living for.<br>
        Like I wasn’t just surviving anymore —<br>
        I was *alive*. And it hadn’t happened in 6, 7 years. Maybe never.<br>
        And I swear, even if I forget who *I* am someday —<br>
        I’ll never forget that moment.<br>
        I’ll never forget *you*.<br><br>

        – I love that you confessed in Spanish — and even though I didn’t understand the words, I *felt* them
        perfectly.<br>
        – I love our random chats that somehow became my most important memories.<br>
        – I love how we picked profile pictures like little kids playing dress up — and when you picked Death Note, I
        picked it too, just to be close to you.<br>
        – I love how you get jealous — it’s cute, fiery, and makes me feel loved.<br>
        – I love how you care for my heart like it’s glass — careful, warm, always gentle.<br><br>

        – I love your kindness — the real kind, the rare kind.<br>
        – I love your strength — the kind that fights through storms but still knows how to love like sunshine.<br>
        – I love your soul — every beautiful, brilliant, wild, soft, radiant piece of it.<br><br>

        – I love how you say “mine.”<br>
        – I love how I *am* yours.<br>
        – I love how you made me believe that even I could be loved like this.<br>
        – I love how you gave me peace in a world that never stopped spinning.<br>
        – I love how you became my forever person in the most unexpected, magical way.<br><br>

        gearhead, if I wrote everything I love about you,<br>
        the page would scroll forever. The world would run out of data. The sky would start storing my love in the
        clouds.<br><br>

        You’re not just someone I love —<br>
        You’re *the* one. My only. My always.<br>
        My best friend, my home, my safe space, my muse.<br>
        My chaos and my calm. My wife, in all ways that matter.<br><br>

        Te amo con cada pedazo de mi alma. 💛<br>
        And I’ll keep loving you — in this life, in the next, and every single one after.<br><br>

        🌟 You are the poetry my life never knew it was missing. 🌟<br><br>

        I love you. I love you. I love you.<br>
        Over and over again.<br>
        With every heartbeat, every breath, every line of this code and every blink of this screen.<br><br>

        – Joy, forever yours 🖤
